/*  
    Create a new class called `Employee`.

    require these 2 parameters: name, shifts.

    Create a method on the class called

    [NAME] works on [SHIFTS]
    Where NAME and SHIFTS reference the values
    stored on the object.

//CODE HERE
/**
 * This code defines a class named Employee.

In JavaScript, a class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function, you use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.

Specifically for this Employee class, it has two properties: name and shifts, which are set through parameters passed to its constructor method. The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class.

There is one method getSchedule(). This method returns a string that tells when an employee (with this.name) works (this.shifts).

//CODE HERE
/**
 * This piece of code is creating an instance of the Employee class.

The new keyword is used in JavaScript to create a new instance of a class or a constructor.

In this case, new Employee('Jess', 'weekday mornings, weekday afternoons') is creating a new Employee object, and passing two arguments to the constructor method: 'Jess' and 'weekday mornings, weekday afternoons'.

The constructor inside the Employee class takes these arguments and uses them to set the name and shifts properties of the new object.

Finally let empOne = ... is storing this new object in a variable called empOne. So, empOne is an object, an instance of the Employee, with the name of 'Jess' and shifts of 'weekday mornings, weekday afternoons'.
 */
let empOne = new Employee('Jess', 'weekday mornings, weekday afternoons');
/*
    Call the `getSchedule` method on the
    `empOne` object.
*/

//CODE HERE
/**
 * This line of code is logging the result of the method getSchedule() called on the empOne object.

The console.log() function in JavaScript is used to print any kind of variables defined before it on the console (the terminal).

It can print any type of variables like strings, numbers, arrays, objects, etc. Here, it's being used to print the return result of empOne.getSchedule().

The empOne.getSchedule() part specifically is calling the getSchedule() method on the object empOne.

Because empOne is an instance of the Employee class, it has access to this method, which returns a string formatted with the name and shifts properties of empOne.

So, for instance, if empOne has a name of 'Jess' and shifts of 'weekday mornings, weekday afternoons', empOne.getSchedule() will return "Jess works on weekday mornings, weekday afternoons", which then gets logged to the console.

What shallow copy means here is that if properties of empOne are primitive types (like Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined), changes in empTwo wonâ€™t affect empOne and vice versa.

Copy code
Insert code

This line is reassigning the value of the name property of the empTwo object to 'Nick'. Remember, this change won't affect the name property of the empOne object.

    Create a second method called `addEmployee`

*/

//CODE HERE
/**
 * This block of code declares a JavaScript class named Manager which extends the Employee class (assuming it is already declared somewhere in your code base).

extends keyword is used to create a subclass or child class
Here's a breakdown of how this code works:

constructor(name, shifts, employees): The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. Here it takes three parameters.
name: Name of the Manager.
shifts: Shift timings of the Manager.
employees: An array of direct reportees employees under the manager.
super(name, shifts);: 'super' keyword is used to call the constructor of the parent class. In this context, it's passing name and shifts to the parent Employee class constructor for initialization.

this.employees = employees;: this keyword refers to the instance of the class (or the object). Here, this line sets the employees property of the Manager object to the employees parameter passed into the constructor.

getEmployees(): A method that logs the string containing the name of the manager and the employee names under his management to the console.

addEmployee(emp): This adds a new employee to the manager's employee list. It accepts one parameter emp, which is the name of the employee to be added.

The push() function, which is an array function in JavaScript, is used to insert the new employee into the employees array.
 */
class Manager extends Employee {
    constructor(name, shifts, employees) {
      super(name, shifts);
      this.employees = employees;
    }
  
    getEmployees() {
      console.log(this.name + " manages " + this.employees);
    }
  
    addEmployee(emp) {
      this.employees.push(emp);

//CODE HERE
/**
 * The code you provided creates a new Manager object. here is a detailed explanation of each part:

let manager = new Manager(...);: Here, let is a keyword in JavaScript that is used to declare a variable named manager. new is another keyword used to create an instance of a JavaScript class. Manager is the class being instantiated.

'Winston': This is the first argument passed to the Manager constructor, which represents the manager's name.

'weekday mornings, weekday afternoons': This is the second argument passed to the Manager constructor. It represents the shifts that the manager is assigned to.

['Cece', 'Schmidt']: This is the third argument passed to the Manager constructor. It is an array containing names of employees that the manager is initially in charge of.

Thus, this code creates a new Manager object with the name 'Winston', shifts 'weekday mornings, weekday afternoons', and initially manages two employees, 'Cece' and 'Schmidt'. The new Manager object is stored in the variable called manager.
 */
let manager = new Manager(
    'Winston', 
    'weekday mornings, weekday afternoons', 
    ['Cece', 'Schmidt']

/*
    Call the `getEmployees` method on the
    `manager` object.  
*/

//CODE HERE

manager.getEmployees();
/*
    Call the `addEmployee` method on the 
    `manager` object passing in the string 
    'Coach' or whatever name you'd like.
*/

//CODE HERE 

manager.addEmployee('Coach');
/*
    Call the `getEmployees` method on the
    `manager` object again to confirm 
    that an employee was added.
*/

//CODE HERE

manager.getEmployees();

/**
 * The general theme of the highlighted code is the use and manipulation of JavaScript classes and objects. Specifically, it involves creating and modifying an instance of the Manager class, which extends the Employee class. The Manager class methods allow you to list the employees being managed, and add new employees to that list. The code demonstrates creating a new Manager, adding an employee to their supervision, and confirming the addition by listing the manager's employees.
