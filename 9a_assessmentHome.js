 * a constant value greetUser is declared as an arrow function. The function is assigned a single parameter (username).

Inside the arrow function, a string is returned using template literals. Template literals are a way to allow embedded expressions and variables inside a string. They are enclosed by back-ticks (`), not quotes.

The ${username} inside the back-ticks is a placeholder that gets replaced by the value of the username parameter. In the greetUser function, it will be replaced by whatever argument is passed when calling this function.

The final line console.log(greetUser('Andrew')); is simply executing or calling the greetUser function with the string 'Andrew' as the username argument. As the greetUser function returns a string, this call will return 'Welcome back, Andrew'.

The output of this code to the console will be: Welcome back, Andrew.âˆ‘

    If the zip code passed in is in the array,
    return a string letting the user know they
    are eligible for delivery. If they are not, 
    return a string letting them know that. 

    For example:
    canWeDeliver(84606) 
        // `Sorry, we can't deliver to that address`
    canWeDeliver(85205) 
        // `You're in our delivery zone!`

    Problem 2 Continued

    Now you're going to rewrite your function.

    If you wrote `canWeDeliver` using a loop of
    some kind, write a new function (`canWeDeliverTwo`)
    below, using the `includes` array method. 
    Look it up on MDN if you're not sure how to use 
    it. 

    If you already used the `includes` method, 
    write a new function using some sort of 
    loop (for loop, higher order array method).
    Name your new function `canWeDeliverTwo`.
*/

// CODE HERE
/**
 * The JavaScript function canWeDeliverTwo(zipCode) uses a parameter called zipCode to check whether delivery is possible to a particular zip code. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

First, const deliveryAreaZipCodes = [85205, 85204, 85203, 85213, 85206]; defines a constant array that contains the zip codes where delivery is possible.

Next, the function starts a for loop that will iterate through each zip code in the deliveryAreaZipCodes array. The starting index (i) is 0, and it increments by 1 (i++) until it reaches the last index of the array (i < deliveryAreaZipCodes.length).

Inside the for loop, there's an if statement that checks if the current zipCode provided as an argument to the function matches the current zip code in the deliveryAreaZipCodes array (deliveryAreaZipCodes[i] === zipCode).

If there's a match, the function immediately returns the string "You're in our delivery zone!". This stops the function and no further code is executed.

If the entire for loop completes without a match (meaning the input zip code is not in the deliveryAreaZipCodes array), the function then returns "Sorry, we can't deliver to that address".

In summary, the function canWeDeliverTwo(zipCode) checks whether a specific zip code is within a delivery area, and then delivers an appropriate message based on whether the zip code is found in the delivery area list or not.

const canWeDeliverTwo = (zipCode) => {
    const deliveryAreaZipCodes = [85205, 85204, 85203, 85213, 85206];
    for (let i = 0; i < deliveryAreaZipCodes.length; i++) {
        if (deliveryAreaZipCodes[i] === zipCode) {
            return "You're in our delivery zone!";
        }
    }
    return "Sorry, we can't deliver to that address";
};
console.log(canWeDeliverTwo(85204));
console.log(canWeDeliverTwo(83301));

deals[0]: This accesses the first object in the 'deals' array. In JavaScript, arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element is accessed with the index 0.

.title: This part accesses the 'title' property of the selected object. Combining this with deals[0] we get deals[0].title, which represents the 'title' property of the first object in the 'deals' array. For the given array, this would originally return '15% Off!'.

deals[0].title.replace('15', '10'): The replace function is a built-in JavaScript string method that replaces some specified text with some other text. Here, it replaces '15' with '10' in the string '15% Off!'. This results in the string '10% Off!'.

deals[0].title = ...: This takes the result of deals[0].title.replace('15', '10') and reassigns it to deals[0].title. This modifies the original 'title' property of the first object in the 'deals' array and changes it from '15% Off!' to '10% Off!'.

deals[1]: This accesses the second object in the 'deals' array. In JavaScript, arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the index 1 corresponds to the second item in the array.

.desc: This accesses the 'desc' property of the selected object. So deals[1].desc refers to the description of the second deal.

deals[1].desc.replace('March', 'April'): The replace() function is a built-in JavaScript string method which changes a specified text with another text. In this context, it replaces the word 'March' with 'April' in the description string of the second deal.

.trim(): The trim() function is another built-in JavaScript string method that removes any leading or trailing white spaces from the string.

deals[1].desc = ...: This will reassign the result from deals[1].desc.replace('March', 'April').trim() back to deals[1].desc. This modifies the original 'desc' property of the second deal in the 'deals' array, replacing 'March' with 'April' and removing leading or trailing white spaces.
